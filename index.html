                        The Audi R7 is a mythical concept car, which means it has never been produced or commercially sold. However, Audi has showcased several concept cars under the "R" purview, like the Audi R8 and Audi R6. The R7 was likely inspired by Audi's successful racing history, particularly in the Dakar Rally and the World Rally Championship.
